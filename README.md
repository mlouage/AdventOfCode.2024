# AdventOfCode.2024

Advent Of Code solutions for 2024. This is my first attempt at writing it in Go. 
Comments to help me write more idiomatic Go code are welcome. Please list them in the issues. 
I also used Claude to review my Go code for me in order to learn. The conversations I have with Claude are also visible 
in the issues and pull requests.

## Getting Started

The challenges are split up by day. I use unit tests to get the necessary output for the challenges.

```bash
make test
```
