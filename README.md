# AdventOfCode.2024

Advent Of Code solutions for 2024. This is my first attempt at writing it in Go. 
Comments to help me write more idiomatic Go code are welcome. Please lists them in the issues.

## Getting Started

The challenges are split up by day. I use unit tests to get the necessary output for the challenges

```bash
make test
```
